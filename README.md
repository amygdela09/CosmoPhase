Cosmo Phase: A Retro Solar System Simulator

This project is a web-based, interactive 2D model of our solar system, created as a tribute to the iconic Casio Cosmo Phase watch. It combines a nostalgic, retro-futuristic aesthetic with accurate orbital mechanics to provide a beautiful and educational view of our celestial neighborhood.

The entire interface is designed to evoke the feeling of a classic 80s digital watch, featuring a monochrome green-on-black color scheme, blocky UI elements, and pixelated sprites for the sun and planets.
Key Features:

    Accurate Orbital Simulation: Planet positions are not just for show. They are calculated using true Keplerian orbital elements, including semi-major axis, eccentricity, and longitude of perihelion. This means planets follow their correct elliptical paths and vary their speedâ€”moving faster at perihelion (closest to the sun) and slower at aphelion (farthest away).

    Dynamic Time Controls:

        Date Selection: View the precise alignment of the solar system on any given day from the years 1800 to 2100.

        Real-time Mode: See the current positions of the planets, updated live.

        Variable-Speed Timelapse: Watch the planets orbit the sun with an adjustable timelapse feature. The exponential speed slider provides fine control for slower, more detailed animations or incredibly fast forward-time simulations.

    Perfectly Smooth Moon Phase: The moon phase indicator in the top-right corner is rendered dynamically on every frame. By calculating the exact position of the terminator (the line between light and shadow) in real-time, the animation is perfectly fluid and avoids the choppiness of pre-rendered phase images.

    Logarithmic Distance Scaling: To solve the classic problem of visualizing a solar system where outer planets are thousands of times farther away than inner ones, the simulation uses a logarithmic scale for orbital distances. This brings the orbits of all planets, from Mercury to Pluto, into a single, comprehensible view.

    Interactive Viewing: Use the mouse wheel or trackpad to zoom in and out, and hover over any celestial body to identify it.
